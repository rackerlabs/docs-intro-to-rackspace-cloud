Our Products and Services
=========================

The Rackspace Cloud is made up of several services that provide the foundation
for a scalable, reliable, and high-performing cloud environment.

Our Cloud is powered by `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org>`_, the Open Source
Cloud Operating System. OpenStack is an open source project that was founded by
Rackspace and NASA in 2010, and now has over 150 companies contributing code.

TODO: Request 1-2 sentence write-ups of each service from marketing (or pull
from something already created).
