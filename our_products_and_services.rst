Rackspace Cloud Services
========================

The Rackspace Cloud is a set of web services that provide a variety of
infrastructure resources and services on-demand.  This allows users to rapidly
and programatically deploy, manage, and scale applications globally.  All
Rackspace Cloud services are designed to be reliable, easy to use, and high-
performing.

Our cloud is powered by `OpenStack <http://www.openstack.org>`_, the leading
open source cloud Operating System.  By building applications on the Rackspace
Cloud, you are building on OpenStack.  An open cloud platform affords users
unique hybrid deployment scenarios, a broad ecosystem of tooling, and future
flexibility in migrating or expanding to other OpenStack clouds (including your
own) should the need ever arise.

The Rackspace Cloud is comprised of the following services:


Compute Services
----------------

Cloud Servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Virtual and bare metal servers delivered in minutes.  Available in multiple
flavors of CPU, RAM, disk, and network ranging from general purpose to highly
workload optimized.  Powered by the OpenStack `nova
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Nova>`_ project and delivered using Open
Compute hardware.

Cloud Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^
A variety of common Operating System images available for use in Cloud
Servers.Create custom images from servers, import and export images, and share
images with other users.  Powered by the OpenStack `glance
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Glance>`_ project.


Network Services
----------------

Cloud Networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Fully isolated, single tenant networks for Cloud Servers.  Create flexible
network topologies and control IP addressing.  Powered by the OpenStack `neutron
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron>`_ project.

Cloud Load Balancing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Highly available traffic management that autoscales with load.  Supports
multiple protocols, SSL termination, advanced load balancing algorithms,
synthetic health checks, and more.

Cloud DNS
^^^^^^^^^
Domain Name Service (DNS) record management including zone import and export.
Powered by Rackspace's globally distributed and highly available DNS
infrastructure.

RackConnect
^^^^^^^^^^^
Securely connects Rackspace Cloud resources with Rackspace hosted custom,
dedicated infrastructure.


Storage & Content Delivery Services
-----------------------------------

Cloud Block Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reliable block storage for Cloud Servers that scales independent of CPU, RAM,
disk, and network.  Optimize for space with SATA volumes or IO with SSD volumes.
Powered by the OpenStack `cinder <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder>`_
project.

Cloud Files with CDN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Highly scalable and durable object storage.  Direct CDN integration enables you
to quickly serve public content from over 200 edge locations around the world.
Powered by the OpenStack `swift <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift>`_
project.


Database & Data Analytic Services
---------------------------------

Cloud Databases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
High performance, managed MySQL (including Percona and MariaDB) databases
deployed in minutes. Independently scale up RAM and storage as your database
grows. Powered by the OpenStack `trove <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Trove>`_
project.

Cloud Big Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Optimized and managed Apache Hadoop clusters deployed in minutes.  Based on the
open HortonWorks Data Platform.

 
Application Services
--------------------

Cloud Orchestration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use templates to define and predictably deploy and manage collections of
different Rackspace Cloud resources. Powered by the OpenStack `heat
<https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat>`_ project.

Cloud Queues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Scalable message queuing for building distributed applications.  Supports a
producer-consumer model useful for scale out worker architectures as well as a
publisher-subscriber model useful for large scale notifications. Powered by the
OpenStack `marconi <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Marconi>`_ project.

Cloud Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Powerful dual perspective monitoring and alerting for your applications.
Distributed remote checks measure availability from the outside while agent
based checks gather and report information from the inside.

Cloud Auto Scale
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create policies that will automatically scale your application up or down based
on different criteria.

Cloud Backup
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Automated file level backups of your data saved to Cloud Files. Supports
compression, de-duplication, and encryption.
 

Other Services
--------------

ObjectRocket
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Managed, high-performance MongoDB.  Automatic sharding makes scaling simple.
Hardware and software stack designed and highly optimized for extreme MongoDB
performance.

Mailgun
^^^^^^^
Powerful, simple email sending, receiving, and tracking for developers.
