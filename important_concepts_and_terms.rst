Important Concepts and Terms
============================

Regions
-------

At Rackspace, we define a region as a group of one or more data centers (physical buildings) located in close geographic proximity to one another, such that it is possible to achieve <= 3 milliseconds of latency for intra-region network communication.

We currently have the following regions:

 - IAD (Northern Virginia, United States)
 - DFW (Dallas / Fort Worth, Texas, United States)
 - ORD (Chicago, Illinois, United States)
 - LON (London, United Kingdom)
 - SYD (Sydney, Australia)
 - HKG (Hong Kong)

Control Plane
-------------

The control plane for a cloud service is comprised of the API servers and other control infrastructure that you interact with to provision data plane resources. For example, the Cloud Servers public API, scheduler, and database make up portions of the Cloud Servers control plane.

Data Plane
----------

The data plane for a cloud service is where your data resides and ongoing data processing takes place. For example, the host machines housing virtual machine instances comprise the data plane for our Cloud Servers offering.
