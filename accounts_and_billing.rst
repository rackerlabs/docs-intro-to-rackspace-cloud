Accounts and Billing
====================

Creating an Account
-------------------

The first step to leveraging the Rackspace Cloud is to create a cloud account.
As discussed in :ref:`global-versus-uk-cloud` you must first select whether you
want to open a Global or a UK cloud account, depending on which region(s) you
wish to provision resources in. Use one of the following links to create your
cloud account:

 - Global cloud account (all regions except LON):
   https://cart.rackspace.com/cloud
 - London cloud account:
   https://buyonline.rackspace.co.uk/cloud

You will be asked to provide contact information for your new account, select a
username, provide a password, and provide payment information to establish your
account. In some cases, additional verification may be required prior to opening
your account. In that case, a Racker will contact you regarding next steps.

Billing Currencies
------------------

Global cloud accounts are billed in US Dollars (USD). London cloud accounts are
billed in British Pounds (GBP).

Billing Cycle
-------------

Your account will be billed on the monthly anniversary of its creation.

TODO: Confirm and add any additional details (is card charged on the anniversary
date, etc.)

Consolidated Invoicing
----------------------

If you have a Managed Hosting account with Rackspace (dedicated servers,
hardware network devices, etc.) you may choose to consolidate the billing of
your cloud account onto your Managed Hosting bill. To initiate consolidation,
log in to the `MyRackspace Portal <https://my.rackspace.com>`_ or contact your
Account Manager.

Note: Consolidated Invoicing is only available for Managed Hosting accounts
billed in USD and Global cloud accounts.

Tracking Usage
--------------

You may monitor your usage throughout the month by logging in to the `MyCloud
Portal <https://mycloud.rackspace.com>`_ and selecting Usage Overview from the
top right Account menu. Totals update on a daily basis.
