Interaction Methods
===================

Control Panel
-------------

The Rackspace Cloud Control Panel at https://mycloud.rackspace.com is the
easiest way to get started with provisioning cloud resources. In certain cases,
additional functionality may be available via the SDKs or direct APIs, but all
of the most common features are supported in the Control Panel.

Software Development Kits (SDKs)
--------------------------------

Rackspace supports `SDKs <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/>`_ for the
following languages:

 - `Java <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/java/>`_
 - `.Net <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/dot-net/>`_
 - `Node.js <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/node-js/>`_
 - `PHP <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/php/>`_
 - `Python <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/python/>`_
 - `Ruby <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/ruby/>`_

Command-line Clients
--------------------

TODO: Need a unified place on developer.rackspace.com where we list the clients
that we can link to from here.

Direct API Access
-----------------

Each of our cloud services exposes an API which can be leveraged for low-level
integration with the service. For most use cases we recommend leveraging one of
our supported `SDKs <https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/>`_ versus integrating
directly with the APIs.

The API Developer Guides for each service are available at
http://docs.rackspace.com/.
